# nb_extension_twoCol

Simple extension for optional two column Jupyter notebook display

This extension is based on [`Calysto/notebook-extensions/cell-tools`](https://github.com/Calysto/notebook-extensions).

With the extension enabled and installed, a toolbar button is provided that will toggle the display of a selected code cell from a one column to a two column display.

An additional setting (TO DO) provides a view where the notebook is presented to the left hand side of the screen and is draggable / resizable on the right hand side.

```
jupyter nbextension install nb_extension_twoCol --user
jupyter nbextension enable nb_extension_twoCol/cell_tools/main
```
